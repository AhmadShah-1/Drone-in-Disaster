FaceRecognition1: Basic Haarcascade identifier
FaceRecognition2: Check directory for faces already detected (slow)
FaceRecognition3: Using different model and GPU support (Can change face detection to GPU but face recognition is difficult to change to gpu)
FaceRecognition4: Instead of haarcascade or CNN using Yolov8-facedetect



Current Code to be used (2):
(4) is far more accurate and is capable of detecting multiple faces in an image easily,
however we are passing a bounding box that has only 1 face, so singular speed is prioritized
(2) Haarcascades is far faster than a dense neural network and will be used as the working model


Shortcomings:
The face recognition program is using CPU rather than gpu
