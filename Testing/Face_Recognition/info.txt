FaceRecognition1: Basic Haarcascade identifier
FaceRecognition2: Check directory for faces already detected (slow)
FaceRecognition3: Using different model and GPU support (Can change face detection to GPU but face recognition is difficult to change to gpu)
FaceRecognition4: Instead of haarcascade or CNN using Yolov8-facedetect
